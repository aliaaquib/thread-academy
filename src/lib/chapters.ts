/**
 * Topics inside each chapter, grouped by subject.
 * Key = chapter id (the folder name under content/subject/<subject>/grade-<n>/).
 *
 * A topic becomes a real page only when its lesson file exists:
 *   content/subject/<subject>/grade-<n>/<chapter>/<topic>.mdx
 * So adding a topic = adding one line here + one .mdx file. Nothing else changes.
 *
 * Hand-written topics below always come first. getChapterTopics() tops each
 * chapter up to four lessons using chapter-topics-extra.ts.
